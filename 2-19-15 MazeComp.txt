DO YOU WANT A CHANCE TO WIN A FREE CLUB SHIRT?!

Come to our Pragmatic Programming this Thursday for a 2-3 hour programming competition.  The winner will be able to get a club tshirt at no cost when the shirts arrive.

What is the competition?:
Write an algorithm that will traverse a 2D maze in as few steps as possible.  Whoever takes the fewest steps for some randomly generated mazes at the end of the meeting will be declared the winner!
You will have the duration of the meeting to complete it.

Suggested Information
{
- This meeting is an hour longer than normal to allow extra time to program
- Unfortunately, the programming will be required to be in C++
- working in CSIF is suggested
- Perhaps think about looking up some maze-solving/pathfinding algorithms before the competition
-- (warning: you won't be omniscient)
- The winner will be able to claim the prize only once the club tshirts arrive
