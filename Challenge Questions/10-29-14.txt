1) You are given an unsorted array of integers of size N-1.  The array contains the integers 0 to N, but one of the integers is missing.  What ways can you find out what integer is missing?

1.1) Sort array, go through array
O(n^2 + n) for bad sort
O(nlogn + n) for good sort

hash table? access hash table twice
- same as 1.2

1.2) Create 2nd array of bools, mark true if in array, go through array
O( 2n )

1.3) Add up all the integers, substract from what the total should be.
O(n)

What's should the total be?
Loop adding numbers
O(n)
Use formula
((N+1)*N)/2  -- sum of integers from 1 to N, by pascal
O(1)



2) Check whether a given string is a palindrome

2.1) Copy the string, reverse the order. Compare the original to the copy.
O(n) copy
O(n) reverse

2.2) Keep track of beginning char and end char. Compare the two chars.  After each comparison, move each char pointer towards the middle until the end <= beginning.
O(n)



2-1) Find all palindrome substrings in a given string

2-1.1) Check all permutations of substrings
Two for loops
O(n^2)

2-1.2) Go through each char, and 'between' each char.
Set that char (or two chars) as the middle of the palindrome.
Check while moving outwards
O(n) - roughly?



3) Without using the +,-,*,/ operators, how could you write a program to carry out the following calculation:

3.1) Bit adder?
