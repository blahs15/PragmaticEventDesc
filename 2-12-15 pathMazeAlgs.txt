This week will be a pre-competition conversation about pathfinding/maze algorithms.  We are planning on holding a competition soon, and more details will be revealed at the meeting.

Suggested Information

- Nothing will be needed for this meeting, just an interest in learning or contributing :)
- The prize for the competition is planned to be a free club shirt!
- If you get pre-competition jitters, I can go through what the process will be ahead of time at this meeting.
