LAST FEW DAYS ON THE COMPETITION! SUBMISSIONS WILL BE COMPARED AT THE MEETING THIS THURSDAY!

The competition ends this Thursday.  Submissions will be accepted even at the start of the meeting; there's still time to start making an entry.  Remember that submission directions are in the README.txt file.

It was decided (by popular vote) that the prize will be a gift card for In-N-Out.

I'm (Russell Miller) available for questions about any contest rules or about how the minesweeper program works.

- Some rules that were decided that may not be in the README.txt:
-- You must have the first line of your solver be:
  game->revealSquare(game->numRows()/2,game->numCols()/2);
-- The penalty for hitting a mine is 10%
--- ex: 74% revealed --> 64%, 28% --> 18%
-- Read the function descriptions carefully.  Due to some needed quick-bug-fixes, the return values of some functions aren't very intuitive.
-- The prize will be an In-N-Out gift card (by popular vote).


- To get started, if you have a CSIF account, you can copy the files by entering the following on the command line:
cp /home/blahs15/pragmatic/member/Minesweeper . -r
- If you don't have a CSIF account, post here or message the page and I will get the relevant files to you.
- All the needed information is in the README.txt file.
- The README is posted/pinned in the Week 2 event post
