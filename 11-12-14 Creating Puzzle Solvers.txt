***BRING A COMPUTER TO PROGRAM WITH***
please? :(

This week (and maybe the next few meetings too) I will be providing some challenging ideas for people to actually program.  I will be suggesting some puzzles that can normally be solved by hand, and I would like some people to create some solvers for them.

As always, people of all levels are welcome.  You can be fairly new to programming, and there will be people to help you along.  You can have a lot of experience and just have some fun writing something.  Or you can be someone who hasn't coded very many things lately and use this as something to practice with.
