THE COMPETITION CONTINUES! YOU CAN STILL JOIN!

This Thursday marks the halfway point of the two week competition to create the best Minesweeper puzzle Solver program.  The competition does have a prize for the person who creates the best solver.

You don't need to have gone to the last event to participate, you can start at any time, and you don't need to even show up to still be able to participate.  

If there are any questions, feel free to post here or message the page and I will try to help out.
