WE HAVE AN ACTUAL COMPETITION STARTING THIS WEEK!

This Thursday will mark the start of a two week competition to create the best Minesweeper puzzle Solver program.  There's going to be a few small prizes to the winners, and depending on the participation, I may get more!

Rules of the competition will be shared at the event.

Suggested Information
{
- C or C++ will be required for the Solver. (Sorry! Can't change this part.)
- I believe I'm going to make it so that only students can win. (Anyone can participate though.)
