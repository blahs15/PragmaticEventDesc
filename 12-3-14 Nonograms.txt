***BRING A COMPUTER TO PROGRAM WITH*** 
(And charger if you might need it)

Pragmatic Programming will be continuing to work on a Picross puzzle solver for the rest of the quarter.  Next quarter I'm planning on having a competition (hopefully with a prize!) to make the best puzzle solver for a TBA puzzle.  I started this topic to get people into that mindset.

For more information on Picross puzzles, here's the previous Prag event:

Suggested Information:
{
- Bring a Computer.
- A charger can be pretty useful too.
- Bring a friend to work with, or you'll leave having met some new ones.
