Do You Git It?: A Git Tutorial

Pragmatic Programming will be leading the end of the meeting by providing a Git Tutorial. Git can be used to backup your work, show it off to potential employers, and to collaborate with others.

Suggested Information:
{
- The Tutorial will require a computer.
- Installing Git is included in the tutorial, but already having it installed is a good idea.
- We will be grouping people together to learn how to use Git to work with others. So bring some friends if you want!
