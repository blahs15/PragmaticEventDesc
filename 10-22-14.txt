This week, Prag will be more of a kick-back.

I will have last week's GDB Debugging Tutorial available (and hopefully updated more) for anybody who missed it, or would like to ask questions about it.
Last Week's Event Description: https://www.facebook.com/events/1507183549539558

Otherwise, we, the organizers, have had a lot of work to do and weren't able to put much together for this week.  However, we would still prefer to have a meeting on a weekly basis.  Therefore this week is a good week to bring any questions you have.

Some good questions would be about:
- **Pragmatic Programming Committee**
- The CS club in general
- The CS major
- college in general?
- questions about your (CS) classes
- debugging

Since this is a relaxed meeting, you can also bring things like:
- **suggestions of what you would like us to go over**
- homework
- Personal projects
